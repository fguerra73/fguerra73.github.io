#### Short Bio

I'm Full Professor at the Department of Engineering “Enzo Ferrari” from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, where I teach Software Engineering and Big Data Analysis. 

My research interests include **scalable data management and integration** (I'm working on the development of Machine Learning and Deep Learning explainable and fair techniques to the Entity Resolution problem), **data mining and analytics on big data** (I'm working on techniques for anomaly and novelty detection, for supporting machine learning techniques in production), **text analytics and NLP** (I'm working on automatic textual and tabular data analysis),  **semantic web** (I was involved in projects for the creation and alignment of ontologies), and  **keyword based searches on structured datasets**. 

I participated in European and national projects. In particular, I coordinated the KEYSTONE COST Action, years 2013-2017, (IC 1302 KEYSTONE COST Action– Semantic Keyword Search on Structured Data Sources), and the Re-search Alps (INEA/CEF/ICT/A2016/1296967) project, years 2017-2019. I was *Visiting Professor at the University of Rijeka* in 2019. I'm a *visiting reviewer* for the AI thesis at the University of Malta (2022-2024).
