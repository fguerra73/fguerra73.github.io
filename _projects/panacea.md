**Research Units:**
University of Rome 3 
University of Rome  La Sapienza
University of Modena and Reggio Emilia

**Duration**
September 2023 - September 2025

**Research Goals:**

1. **Create an explainable anomaly-based IDS** for a large-scale computer system, where each element (hardware or software component):
   - Has an autonomous behavior described by a multivariate time series with different sampling rates.
   - Operates under possibly unknown conditions.

2. **Develop a robust, scalable, and multi-agent Intrusion Response System** that:
   - Is based on a joint model of defender and attacker.
   - Ensures robustness with respect to model changes.

3. **Establish the first publicly available testbed** for validating Self-Protecting Systems.

**Research Contributions:**

- The first integrated approach to self-protection, combining explainable anomaly-based intrusion detection and intrusion response.
- Utilization of neural network models for local intrusion detection and post-hoc models for explanations.
- Implementation of a stochastic game with a Generative Adversarial Network for scalable and adaptive intrusion response.
- Creation of the Panacea framework for realizing self-protecting systems, validated on a large-scale web-based system.

**Impact and Dissemination:**

- Advances in cyber-security automation, particularly in Anomaly Detection, Intrusion Response, and Secure Software and Platform Engineering.
- Dissemination of scientific results to the research community.
- Development of new course material for undergraduate and graduate curricula in cyber-security, artificial intelligence, and big data.

**Future Applications:**

- Techniques applicable to other domains, including Cloud-Edge continuum systems, critical infrastructures, and Cyber-Physical Systems.
