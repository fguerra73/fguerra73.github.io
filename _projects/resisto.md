**Research Units:**
UNIBO - CIRI ICT
UNIMORE - AIRI
CONSORZIO T3 LAB
ASSOCIAZIONE CLUST-ER INNOVAZION E NEI SERVIZI

**Duration**
October 2023 - April 2026

**Research Goals:**

1. **Develop a digital twins-enabled platform** for resilient and sustainable production in the Industry 5.0 era:
   - Simulate new production chains or productivity goals for existing chains offline.
   - Implement a (re)training platform for personnel with visual learning paths for machine use.

2. **Enhance supply chain management**:
   - Quickly adapt to changes in productivity goals and unforeseen events.
   - Establish an open, integrated, distributed, and automated decision-making system.

**Research Contributions:**

- Implementation of Digital Twin (DT) technology to create digital replicas of production lines.
- Creation of Digital Twins for individual industrial products, semi-finished products, and raw materials.

**Impact and Dissemination:**

- Increased competitiveness of companies by expanding the availability of products/services in the market.
- Improved supply chain resilience to new productivity goals and disruptive events like material crises caused by wars/pandemics.
- Promotion and facilitation of the reuse of used products in similar or different sectors (re-manufacturing and re-purposing).

**Future Applications:**

- Optimization of the movement of goods/products/materials, leading to reduced emissions.
- Accelerated learning curve and increased workforce expertise, improving the quality of human labor.

**Our contributions:**

- Develop ESG performance indicators for the company's supply chain.
- Apply ESG-washing detection techniques.

Anomalies in document content (temporal and spatial) will be studied to evaluate scenarios. Comparison with benchmark companies and news crawling will help identify anomalies. Explanation techniques aid in result interpretation.

Expected outcomes:

- ESG indicator definition and evaluation.
- ESG-washing detection technique assessment.
- Software for ESG indicator extraction and detection.
